<h3>Bean and Brew were one of the first 
    companies in the UK to use fair-trade coffee 
    and all organic milk for their products. Each 
    drink is made exactly to your specifications, 
    for a personal service. They also offer their 
    trademarked flavoured coffees, breakfast 
    items such as porridge, small sweet treats, 
    and pressed sandwiches. Recently theyâ€™ve also 
    added frappes and fruit smoothies in addition 
    to seasonal treats such as the pumpkin spiced 
    latte (for Halloween) and various assorted 
    baked goods.

    different sweet treats and goodies, as well as 
    offering an restaurant experience where you can 
    book a table and enjoy a meal with friends on 
    this website.
