        <h2>About Bean & Brew</h2>
        <p>Bean & Brew are a coffee company owned by Sol Folata and Laura Hisoru. Bean and Brew were one of the first companies in the UK to use fair-trade coffee and all organic milk for their products. Each drink is made exactly to your specifications, for a personal service. They also offer their trademarked flavoured coffees, breakfast items such as porridge, small sweet treats, and pressed sandwiches. Recently theyâ€™ve also added frappes and fruit smoothies in addition to seasonal treats such as the pumpkin spiced latte (for Halloween) and various assorted baked goods.</p>
